# cookcademy
A practice CRUD application built using what I have learned in Swift~~. 

## Technologies Used

This was build with SwiftUI and Xcode with MVVM.

Some of the methodologies used:
  * Toolbars and Sheets
  * Closures
  * Forms and Pickers
  * Protocols and Generics
  * Persistance and Throwing Functions
  * Encoding to JSON

## How to run the app
Clone the repo and open with Xcode

## What the app does
This is a recipe app that allows you to add and store recipes by catagories. 

Below is a video of how the app looks and works.
